2. Jetpack Cat - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/jetpack-cat
   Ever wondered what it would be like to play Minecraft, Pokemon, and Doom at the same time? You’re about to find out. Jetpack Cat Minecraft is what I would call a story exploration adventure pack. I’ve spent the last year, and over 1,800 hours making it. There’s over 1,600 different looking mobs, with over 1,300 variant mob textures, and that’s just the Minecraft mobs. Lycanites mobs have been added and configured from the ground up - they don’t just spawn at night, and they’re everywhere. What can you do against all these powerful monsters when your friends are down and it’s just you? Take out your assault rifle and blast away, because your main weapons are guns. You won’t just run into battle though, you’ll fly, leap and bounce with your movement speed, jump height, attack, and swim speed all having been increased. Double jump your way right to your death, because you’ll die a lot at first. You’ll get better as you discover all the secrets and artifacts I've hidden away for you to use. Find the power and piston gloves to one-shot monsters and make them fly across the map. There’s tons of powerful items you can only find in chests. You’ll have to explore though, because to get to The End to fight Mother and uncover what’s really going on, you’ll need to collect 12 different eyes of ender, spread throughout your world. In the meantime you can capture and collect any and all mobs in little jars, just make sure they’re below 60% health. Hang them on your walls and transport them for whatever reasons you want. Maybe release one in your friends base?

4.  Hunting Monsters - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/huntingmonstersmodpack
   **What is Hunting Monsters: The Witcher Modpack?**
   Hunting Monsters is a modpack inspired by The Witcher games, books, and TV show.  There is little intertwining or canon lore with Andrzej Sapkowski's work except for the school names and monster names. This modpack is a standalone universe with completely new characters, world rules, and lore, but it is more fun when you have background knowledge on The Witcher. You, the players, are Witchers who are hired to hunt monsters for rewards. This modpack is highly recommended to players who have never played a modpack before. This is a horror modpack, and very unforgiving to those who do not prepare.  The invisible hand will not lead you. Completely custom-made content meant for the modpack. Over 250 mob hunting quests and almost 300 naturally generating structures built by friends and I using Pillar mod
5.  Dimension Hopper: The Fall - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/dimension-hopper-the-fall
   Before you arrived, there was a huge _**Dimensional Shift**_ caused by _someone_ or _something_ that messed with a bunch of stuff. Portals, dimensional connections, teleportation, and even _ores_ got jumbled around. You must travel through dozens of dimensions investigating and hopefully getting to the bottom of this _**Dimensional Shift**_. But be careful! As you progress in the pack, there might be additional shifts, causing even more chaos! Do you have what it takes to keep progressing forwards?

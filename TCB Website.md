# Planning

A website for the workers of Technical Components Bulgaria.

It will represent a collection of detailed guides on how to assemble different circuits (main focus) and potentially other technical components.

### Main features
- [ ] Main library page with guides ‚è´ 

- [ ] A search feature to allow workers to quickly locate specific circuits or tutorial topics without navigating through the entire library.

- [ ] A page for each circuit.
 It will consist of: 
 - A presentation and a video showcasing the components and how to assemble
 - A list with all components
 - Pop ups with information about the circuit and each of its components on click

- [ ] 3D rotatable model for each component ( https://chat.openai.com/share/5a9d6089-82ef-4785-adf1-4f6350a8ad2b )


### Notes
1. Break down the assembly process into clear, step-by-step instructions. Use a logical sequence to guide users through the entire process.
2. Ensure the site is optimized for mobile devices, as workers might need access to the information on the go.

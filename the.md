Some students argue that schools don't teach them skills needed for their future but academic knowledge is doing a lot more for us than what we think. The variety of subjects we learn at school helps us to find our passion in life. Students find interest in some subjects and dislike others.

Money management is a big issue. The majority of schools don't have classes about important financial skills like spending, saving and investing. We are let to learn on our own, which might be difficult for some people.

Every subject in school is useful because they help with our ability to learn by expanding our existing knowledge with new concepts and ideas. It is easier to learn new information if our brain connects it to already existing knowledge. For example, studying and understanding literature will be easier with knowledge in history.

Overall, I have mixed feelings on the topic. Some important skills, like finances, aren't taught but school teaches us a lot of essential skills, effective learning being the most useful one because we learn throughout our whole life.

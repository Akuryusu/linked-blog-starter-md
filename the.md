Some students argue that schools don't teach us skills needed for their future but academic knowledge is doing a lot more for us than what we think. The variety of subjects we learn at school helps us to find our passion in life. Students find interest in some subjects and dislike others.

Very important problem is the lack of money management taught in schools. The majority of schools don't have classes specifically have classes to teach us important financial skills like spending, saving and investing. We are let to learn on our terms after we finish school which might be difficult for some people.

Every subject in school is beneficial to us because they enhance our ability to learn. It is easier to learn new information if our brain connects it to already existing knowledge. Every subject strengthens our ability to connect new information with existing knowledge. For example, studying history can help us with understanding literature's context.

To sum up, I have mixed feelings on the topic. There are essential skills, like finances, that schools don't teach us and we are left to learn them on our own but at the same time school teaches us to a lot of very useful skills, effective learning being the most useful skill because we learn throughout our whole life.
